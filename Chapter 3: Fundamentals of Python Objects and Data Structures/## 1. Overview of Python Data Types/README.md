# Overview Of Python Data Types

This section introduces the basic **Python data types** that serve as the fundamental building blocks for writing Python code. Each data type is explained with examples and descriptions to give you a clear understanding of how they work. Below is a summary of the types you'll learn in detail throughout the course.

## Data Types Overview

| **Data Type** | **Type (Keyword)** | **Description** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Integer       | `int`              | Whole numbers, e.g., 3, 300, 200 |
| Floating Point| `float`            | Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 2.3, 100.0 |
| String        | `str`              | Ordered sequence of characters, e.g., "hello", "Sammy", "2000" |
| List          | `list`             | Ordered sequence of objects, e.g., `[10, "hello", 200.3]` |
| Dictionary    | `dict`             | Unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{"name": "Frankie", "age": 5}` |
| Tuple         | `tuple`            | Ordered immutable sequence of objects, e.g., `(10, "hello", 200.3)` |
| Set           | `set`              | Unordered collection of unique objects, e.g., `{10, 20, 30}` |
| Boolean       | `bool`             | Logical values representing `True` or `False` |

## Key Points

- **Integers**: Whole numbers without a decimal point.
- **Floating Point Numbers**: Numbers with a decimal point, even if the decimal is `.0`.
- **Strings**: Can contain text, numbers, or even special characters enclosed in quotes.
- **Lists**: Allow an ordered sequence of mixed data types.
- **Dictionaries**: Store data in key-value pairs and are unordered.
- **Tuples**: Similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their content cannot change.
- **Sets**: Hold unique objects with no particular order.
- **Booleans**: Represent logical states of `True` or `False`.
