# String Indexing and Slicing in Python

## Overview
This document provides an introduction to string indexing, slicing, and step size manipulation in Python. These techniques allow you to access and manipulate specific parts of a string.

## Indexing

### Accessing Characters
- Strings in Python are **indexed** starting from `0`.
- You can access individual characters in a string using square brackets `[]`.
  
```python
mystring = "Hello World"
print(mystring[0])   # Output: H
print(mystring[8])   # Output: r
