# Python Tuples Overview

Tuples in Python are a data structure similar to lists, but with one key difference: **immutability**. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, modified, or reassigned.

## Key Features

- **Immutable**: Once a tuple is defined, its elements cannot be altered.
- **Ordered**: Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning the position of each item is fixed.
- **Indexable**: Elements within a tuple can be accessed using their index.
- **Mixed Data Types**: A tuple can hold elements of different data types (e.g., strings, integers, floats).

## Syntax

Tuples are created by placing elements inside parentheses `()` separated by commas.

```python
# Example of a tuple
t = (1, 2, 3)
