# Python Dictionaries Overview

Dictionaries are a powerful data structure in Python used to store key-value pairs, allowing quick access to data without needing to know the specific index position. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

## Key Features

- **Unordered Mappings**: Dictionaries do not store items in a particular order, and their contents cannot be sorted.
- **Key-Value Pairing**: Objects are stored as key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a specific value.
- **Efficient Access**: Unlike lists, where elements are accessed by index, dictionary elements are accessed using their keys.
