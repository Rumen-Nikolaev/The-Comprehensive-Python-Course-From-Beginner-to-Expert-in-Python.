# Python For Loops - README

## Overview

This document provides an overview of how to use `for` loops in Python to iterate over various types of iterable objects such as lists, strings, and tuples. A `for` loop allows us to execute a block of code for each element in an iterable object.

### Key Concepts:
- **Iterable Object**: Any object in Python that you can iterate over, such as lists, strings, and dictionaries.
- **Loop Syntax**: Python's `for` loop syntax allows us to loop through each item in an iterable object and perform an action for each item.

## Syntax of a For Loop

Here is a basic syntax of a `for` loop:

```python
my_iterable = [1, 2, 3]  # List of numbers
for item in my_iterable:
    print(item)
